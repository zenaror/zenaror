I use GitHub to share **personal and experimental projects**, where I mix my passion for technology, gaming, and retro hardware. Some examples include:

- **[Pico Adapter GB](https://github.com/zenaror/PicoAdapterGB)** – a custom adapter project to emulate the Mobile Adapter GB 
- **[Neo GB Printer](https://github.com/zenaror/NeoGB-Printer)** – modern take on the classic Game Boy Printer
